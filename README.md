# Python Learning Workspace

This workspace is designed for learning Python programming by answering a set of questions. Each answer is implemented as a function in a module, and all functions can be imported and executed from `main.py`.

## Structure
- `main.py`: Entry point to execute answers.
- `questions/`: Package containing modules (e.g., `question_set1.py`, `question_set2.py`) with functions for each question.
- Each module contains multiple functions, each answering a specific question.
- Easily expandable with more modules and packages.

## How to Use
1. Write your answers as functions in the appropriate module inside the `questions` package.
2. Import and call these functions from `main.py` to execute them.
3. Add new modules to `questions/` as needed.
